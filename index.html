        <h1>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h1>

            1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the
            Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how

          <li class="page-li">
            1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to
            budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school
            study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent
            plants.
          </li>
          <li class="page-li">
            1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor
            attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work
            on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
            applied science.
          </li>
          <li class="page-li">
            1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
          </li>
          <li class="page-li">
            1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his
            pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology
            program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
            strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties
            for each major climate on Earth.
          </li>
          <li class="page-li">
            1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling
            wheat yields
          </li>
          <li class="page-li">
            1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
            high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well
            to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
          </li>
          <li class="page-li">
            1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to
            the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due
            to a rapidly expanding population
          </li>
          <li class="page-li">1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
          <li class="page-li">
            1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their
            maize and sorghum yields
          </li>
          <li class="page-li">
            1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University
          </li>
          <li class="page-li">
            2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by
            2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we
            can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
            crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
            modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called
            it science, people were selecting the best breeds."

          <li class="page-li">2009 - dies at the age of 95.</li>
